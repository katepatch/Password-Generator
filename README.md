# Challenge Three
# Password Generator
started off by creating my strings for possible letter/number/character use for random generation.
Then got into the function of generating the password.  Had a lot of trouble with this part.  Could not seem to get the button to work unless i was refreshing the page and then it would automatically pop up without prompt from button.
So I figured out how the get the function to let me decide what criteria i would like for the password.  Still haven't been able to generate a password.  
This has been an incredibly frustrating assignment!  I have been looking all over to figure this out.  rewatching classes and googling and I am just stumped.
